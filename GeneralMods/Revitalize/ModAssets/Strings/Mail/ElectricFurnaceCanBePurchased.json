 "MailContents":"Hey @,^I've been working on an improved furnace that uses battery packs to smelt objects instead of coal!^It has the added benefit that each battery pack can smelt a number of objects before being depleted as well as being more efficient than a normal furnace! This should help pollute less into the environment which I'm sure will make my dad happy as well.^I told mom to start selling you a copy of the blueprints in the shop, so come on by and thanks for supporting me!^ -Maru"
